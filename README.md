# ASSIGNMET 2

1. I have not done file merging into pos_tagger.py, due to technical issue in my system.

2. Submitted nlp_a2_ffnn.py file for Feed Forward Neural Network POS Tagger.

3. Submitted nlp_a2_lstm.py file for Recurrent Neural Network POS Tagger.

4. Submitted NLP_A2_FFNN and NLP_A2_LSTM also.

5. I have done the parameter tunning for both(FFNN and LSTM). Attached the screenshots in report.

6. Drive link for .ipynb file for FFNN:
